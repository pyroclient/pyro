# Pyro Client

Pyro is a hardly working and barely compatible client skidded from repos and gists on github we will not tell you where to find because we want your money.

We make sure to give updates every 2 years and get cracked every 2 months.

When we get cracked, our incompetent community of 9 year olds make sure to tell people that the cracks are ratted so we still get our money!
