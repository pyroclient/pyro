# Pyro Client

Pyro is a hardly working and barely compatible client skidded from repos and gists on github we will not tell you where to find because we want your money.

We make sure to give updates every 2 years and get cracked every 2 months.

When we get cracked, our incompetent community of 9 year olds make sure to tell people that the cracks are ratted so we still get our money!

Our developers hardly keep in touch with the community and our support team is so fast that they respond over 8 hours late to issues and tickets!

Dont open an issue or pull request that we disagree with because we will always close it even if you have valid points! Our 9 year old fans don't know how to navigate github so they cant find closed prs or issues and will keep feeding us money!

In fact, our incompetent developers run off of an IV supply of PayPal balance! 

Adding a new client to your mods folder with Pyro? Make sure to only wait 20 minutes for the loader to work and your new client will probably crash!  

Waiting for 1.5 to release? We're still 90% done the new loader like we said 4 months ago. 1.5 will be rewritten in Kotlin and will have none of your feature requests or suggestions! We just want to rewrite in Kotlin to add compatibility for modules of other clients we skid from!            

The 1.5 loader is guaranteed to be 75% slower and will not display an option to launch 1.5 to public users! Public users get to see Pyro 1.5 when Ionar gives up again and Pyro goes open source.

Want a refund? Sure, you can have one! Just be aware that when 1.5 releases you won't be able to have it back!

Pyro is by far one of the worst, least bypassing clients in the world. Download today at pyroclient.com or pyro.nuker.dev (we dont know which domain to register under lole so pick either one!)
