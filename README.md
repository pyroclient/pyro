# Pyro Client

Pyro is a hardly working and barely compatible client skidded from repos and gists on github we will not tell you where to find because we want your money.

We make sure to give updates every 2 years and get cracked every 2 months.

When we get cracked, our incompetent community of 9 year olds make sure to tell people that the cracks are ratted so we still get our money!

Our developers hardly keep in touch with the community and our support team is so fast that they respond over 8 hours late to issues and tickets!

Dont open an issue or pull request that we disagree with because we will always close it even if you have valid points! Our 9 year old fans don't know how to navigate github so they cant find closed prs or issues and will keep feeding us money!

In fact, our incompetent developers run off of an IV supply of PayPal balance! 

Pyro is by far one of the worst, least bypassing clients in the world. Download today at pyroclient.com or pyro.nuker.dev (we dont know which domain to register under lole so pick either one!)
